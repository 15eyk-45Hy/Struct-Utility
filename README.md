# Struct-Utility

**Structure and OOP simulation in Batch**

<br>

This utility provides a massive structural level-up, transforming standard Batch files

into a clean and well-organized environment.

## Installation & Quick Setup

To get started, download the latest `Struct Utility.zip` from the **Releases** section. After that, follow these setup instructions:

• **1.** Extract the ZIP archive completely.

• **2.** The `Struct Utility` folder is the **core root directory** of the engine.

• **3.** Create your game folder, place the engine's root directory inside it, and create your main game file there.

<br>

⬡ **Advanced Configuration:**

If you want to place your main game file in a separate folder where the engine's root directory is **not** in the same root scope, you must change the settings parameter:
Set `SEPARATE_GAME_DIR=true` (by default, it is set to `false`).
  
<br>

###  Configuration Scenarios
Copy the initialization block into the beginning of your main script. Choose one of the 3 path scenarios below by adjusting the `SEPARATE_GAME_DIR` flag:

<br>

#### Scenario **A**: "Lazy Mode" (All-in-one directory)

*The quickest way for raw testing. Your game script is placed directly inside the utility folder next to `engine.bat`.*

▫ Settings: `set "SEPARATE_GAME_DIR=false"`

```
</details>

<br>

#### Scenario **B**: "Simple Mode" (Standard Separation)
*Clean and organized. A main project folder holds your game script, and the utility folder sits right next to it.*

▫ Settings: `set "SEPARATE_GAME_DIR=false"`

└─➣ 📁 Struct Utility/       ◄• The engine folder sits alongside it
```
</details>

<br>

#### Scenario **C**: "Advanced Mode" (Engine One Level Above)
*Perfect for multi-project workspaces where the engine core is completely separated from isolated game apps.*

## Syntax & Usage

<br>

**1. How to define a new Class**

To create a class for your objects with strict data types, use the following syntax:

```batch
%ES-engine% struct "OptMode-true/false" "ClassName" "DataType:PropertyName" "DataType:PropertyName" ... (and so on)
```
Example:
```batch
%ES-engine% struct "OptMode-true" "resources" "str:display_name" "int:price"
```
• **`"OptMode-true"`** - Speeds up processing. **NOTE:** While enabled, existing class structures are locked and cannot be updated until optimization mode is turned off. *(Recommended for release).*

• **`OptMode-false`** — Standard mode. Allows full dynamic updates and overwriting of structure blueprints on the fly. *(Recommended for debugging).*

  <br>
  
#### Q: Why build an OOP engine inside Windows Batch?

**A:** Windows Batch is historically limited, lacking native support for classes, objects, and type validation. **Struct-Utility** was created to challenge
these limitations, demonstrating that with advanced scripting mechanics (like recursive token loops and variable expansion hacks), you can bring a modern,
structured architecture to vanilla CMD scripts.

<br>

#### Q: Is there really no limit to the number of class properties?

**A:** Technically, there is no hard limit—thanks to the dynamic `SHIFT` loop, you can pass 20 or more properties. However, keep in mind that **the more properties you add, the slower the class initialization becomes**. Processing a massive number of properties requires more CPU cycles and disk writes in Windows Batch, so it is recommended to keep your structs optimal and clean.

<br>

#### Q: Will this slow down my game or application during gameplay?

**A:** Reading values from an initialized entity is instant because they are loaded directly into RAM environment variables. To maximize performance during file creation, you can toggle `OptMode-true` to prevent unnecessary hard drive write cycles and use high-speed metadata caching.
</details>

<br>

**2. Instantiating an Entity**

To instantiate an entity from a defined class, use the syntax below:

```batch
%ES-engine% new "ClassName" "EntityName" "Value 1" "Value 2" ... (and so on)
```

Example:
```batch
%ES-engine% new "resources" "wood" "Pine Wood" "50"
```

<br>

• **Overflow Protection:** If the number of passed values exceeds the allowed property count defined in the class, the engine halts and fires Error.

• **Underflow Behavior:** If you pass fewer values than the class requires, the remaining properties will remain uninitialized (empty).

• **Variable Access Pattern:** Injected variables are stored in RAM using the following strict template: `!ClassName.EntityName.PropertyName!`

• **Object Overwriting:** Running the `new` command on an existing `EntityName` will completely overwrite its previous data.
</details>

<br>

**3. How to set up a Namespace**

To bind classes to a namespace, use the following syntax:

```batch
%ES-engine% namespace "NameSpaceName" "ClassName" "ClassName" ... (and so on)
```

Example:
```batch
%ES-engine% namespace "items" "resources"
```

<details>

<br>

• **Multi-Class Binding:** You can bind multiple different classes to a single namespace within a single command call.

• **Nested / Cascading Namespaces:** The engine supports deep nesting. By executing the namespace command sequentially, you can chain multiple namespaces together to create advanced tree-like structures (e.g., `!models.items.resources.iron.price!`).

• **Deep Variable Access Pattern:** After executing the namespace command, variables become accessible via a nested structure: `!NamespaceName.ClassName.EntityName.PropertyName!`

• **Empty Class Protection:** If you try to resolve a namespace for a class that has no active initialized entities, the engine will trigger an error and halt.

## Practical Example

<br>

Here, I will demonstrate what kind of nested structure tree you can build, using a clear example from gamedev.

This is the type of object tree you can create by using the following syntax:
